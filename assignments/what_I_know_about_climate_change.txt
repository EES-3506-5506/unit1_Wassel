Climate change is becoming a serious issue for our planet as we have already raised global temperatures by 1.5 degrees Celsius. This is occuring due to the increase of green house gasses in the atmosphere, which are causing more radiation to be emitted back to Earth rather than escaping the atmosphere. With temperatures rising we are seeing melting of our ice sheets in the polar regions, which is contributing to sea level rise. We know sea level is rising by using data from sensors on the coast and satallite data to compare to past observations. We also know that carbon dioxide concentrations are higher than past concentrations due to analysis of air bubbles in ice cores. This is creating problems for life on Earth as these changes are happening at a rapid pace and organisms do not have the time to adapt to these new conditions we are creating from the burning of fossil fuels.
